# Configure NOOA models

Produce a usable registry entry for the user's actual route, and state what was
verified. Keep model configuration separate from agent prompts and strategies.

## Locate the configuration before changing it

- For a diagnostic handoff, inspect its running package/version, target file,
  effective alias source, registry chain, credential source and remaining token budget.
- Use `nooa.llm_config.llm_config_chain()` to inspect active sources and
  `nooa.unifiedllm.registry.reload_registry(Path(...))` to load a specific file.
  An explicit output file is not necessarily in the runtime's discovery chain;
  a higher-priority alias can shadow the saved entry.
- Confirm the target alias/file and preserve other aliases and unknown fields.
  Prefer Connect's edit/write path over rebuilding a registry from selected entries.
- Keep keys in environment variables or NOOA's layered `secrets.yaml`, never in
  registry entries, shell arguments, reports or commits. `--prompt-key` provides
  masked input. Persisting a pasted key requires separate consent; check whether
  a project secrets file shadows the user file.

Read [Connect](../../docs/model-connect.md) for CLI stages, editing, budgets and
library contracts, or [Model configuration](../../docs/model-configuration.md)
for saved settings and file discovery. These paths are relative to the source
checkout. If the skill was copied elsewhere, use the absolute installation references in the handoff;
a wheel without docs needs the matching source version/commit, not arbitrary main.

## Choose the relevant workflow

**Guided setup:** recommend `uv add "nooa[cli]"` and `uv run nooa connect`.
Connect suggests/configures the reply token cap, records known or supplied
context size, lists chosen media formats, and tests tools, reasoning, and caching.
`--edit-model ALIAS` edits an existing entry; `--edit-model` alone opens the
registry selector. Wizard `--yes` confirms checks and saving without asking,
but does not save a newly pasted key. Confirm consent before transmitting user data.

**Agent CLI:** stage mode produces JSON and never saves implicitly.
`plan` and `save` send no requests; `discover` and `catalogue` fetch metadata.
`interfaces`, `routing`, `tools`, `reasoning`, `media`, `session`, and `all` run
model checks without confirmation. Set explicit reply caps and token budgets,
inspect the planned timeouts, and stop on exhaustion. Failed calls consume
tokens too. Run only relevant stages to investigate a known failure.

**Planning reference:** build an unsaved entry with `connect.plan` or `--stage plan`.
Validate saved YAML with `reload_registry(Path(...))`; that proves local loading,
not credentials or endpoint support. Unknown capabilities stay unknown.
`--no-probe` skips model checks but may fetch discovery/catalogue metadata;
supply an exact model/interface/endpoint plus `--no-catalogue` to skip that too.

```sh
# Unsaved proposal, not a verified connection:
uv run nooa connect your-model --stage plan --as work \
  --endpoint https://gateway.example/v1 --api-style chat \
  --api-key-env MODEL_KEY --max-tokens 32768 > model-plan.json

# Save the proposal explicitly:
uv run nooa connect --stage save --input model-plan.json --output llm_config.yaml
# Make this explicit output discoverable to the application:
export NEMO_OO_LLM_CONFIG="$PWD/llm_config.yaml"
```

Stage `save` requires `--yes` to confirm replacement of an existing alias.
Read `checks`, `warnings` and `run_context`, not just exit
status: 0 means that stage met its criterion, 1 means failure or missing evidence,
and 2 means invalid options. Saving an untested plan is not successful validation.

**Library:** import `from nooa.unifiedllm import connect`. Use `plan` to propose,
`check_stage` or `run_steps` for checks, and `write` for explicit
persistence. The library never prompts. Run through the same
registry client and formatter as the application; do not substitute raw SDK
probes and call that validation of a NOOA entry.

## Keep settings truthful

- Use the endpoint's exact model ID and supported interface, not guesses from
  its name. Chat uses `client_type: completion`; Responses uses
  `client_type: responses`; Anthropic Messages uses the completion client and
  its Anthropic route prefix. Connect normalizes provider prefixes and base URLs.
- New Connect entries carry `transport: direct`. Runtimes with direct SDK support
  use it to bypass LiteLLM; older runtimes ignore it. Preserve explicit transport
  choices when editing. Check the installed runtime before describing probes as
  direct-transport validation: the saved field alone is not evidence.
- Explicit user choices win; endpoint-reported limits take precedence over
  public catalogue suggestions. Do not add input/output limits to invent a total
  context window. Record unknown context capacity as unverified.
- The saved reply cap is `max_tokens` for all three interfaces; Responses maps
  it to `max_output_tokens` on the wire. Catalogue output ceilings are metadata,
  not recommendations. Keep the selected cap below the known context window.
  Configured checks send this cap, including a selected level’s override; only
  initial interface discovery uses a smaller cap. Insufficient token budget
  skips checks rather than lowering their caps. If no check sent the saved cap, report it
  as unverified. Thinking and the final answer can share the cap; a level-specific
  thinking budget needs answer headroom.
- Connect defaults Responses entries to `store: false` and
  `include: [reasoning.encrypted_content]`. Preserve explicit choices.
  `include: []` is the persisted opt-out for a route that rejects the field;
  unrelated errors are not evidence of rejection. Do not hide these fields or
  reply caps inside `extra_body`.
- Caching defaults to `auto`: use the default cached renderer's stable boundary,
  not a test-only cache override. Other Chat routes may cache implicitly;
  Responses and recognized Anthropic routes have explicit marker mappings.
  `cache_breakpoint: null` opts out of NOOA markers, not provider implicit caching.

## Configure media

Set each model's `media_inputs` to the formats its provider accepts: `image`,
`audio`, `video`, `pdf`. `File` supports PDFs with MIME type `application/pdf`.
Use [nooa-media](../nooa-media/SKILL.md) for examples.

- `--media-inputs image,pdf` saves your chosen formats without testing them.
  An empty list means text-only. Formats left out become text notices in requests.
- `--stage media --test-media-inputs image,pdf` runs the text check and generated
  samples. Audio/video checks run only for Chat. Read passed, failed and skipped
  results before saving; a pass confirms access, not general accuracy.
- To skip checks and metadata lookup in the wizard, supply the exact model,
  endpoint and API style plus `--no-probe --no-catalogue`.

Keep the existing formats when editing the same model. Check the provider's
supported formats when configuring a different model or endpoint.

## Interpret failures and evidence separately

Model listing may be public: it does not validate inference credentials.
A timeout or server error does not prove an unsupported API. A truncated reply
is inconclusive. To test a larger limit, explicitly change the configuration,
rebuild the plan, and rerun within the token budget and known ceiling.
Connect does not silently retry with a different cap than the saved configuration.

For reasoning, distinguish request acceptance, settings reaching the wire,
reasoning observed in the reply, and state replayed in the next request. An
accepted effort field may be ignored; a correct puzzle answer alone does not
prove reasoning support. A route that exposes no reasoning is unconfirmed, not
necessarily non-reasoning. Session checks must retain both settings and available
state. Never print reasoning text, signatures, encrypted state or raw error bodies.

For caching, compare a stable prefix and continuation cache-read usage. A later
miss does not erase a successful continuation hit; implicit provider cache misses
are warnings, not proof that an otherwise working entry is broken. Report missing
markers separately from markers sent with no reported reuse.

After a fix, rerun only affected checks within the existing token budget. Hand off
the alias, target/effective file, change, sanitized outcomes and unverified
capabilities. Do not overwrite unrelated entries or raise budgets implicitly.

## Configure reasoning levels

Declare choices for the **configured route**, not a model family inferred from
its name. Each `reasoning_levels` label maps to exact request parameters;
selection replaces whole top-level values, with no nested merge. Repeat any
nested settings that must survive a level change.

For a Responses route that accepts this request shape, adapt this
`llm_config.yaml` example (replace the placeholder model and configure its key):

```yaml
models:
  my-route:
    model_name: openai/your-model
    client_type: responses
    max_tokens: 32768
    store: false
    include: [reasoning.encrypted_content]
    reasoning: {effort: medium, summary: auto}
    reasoning_default: medium
    reasoning_levels:
      low: {reasoning: {effort: low, summary: auto}}
      medium: {reasoning: {effort: medium, summary: auto}}
      high: {reasoning: {effort: high, summary: auto}}
```

The following example makes an inference request.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from nooa.unifiedllm import get_llm_client
from nooa.unifiedllm.registry import reload_registry

reload_registry(Path("llm_config.yaml"))
llm = get_llm_client("my-route", reasoning_level="high")  # persistent selection
levels = llm.reasoning_levels
default = llm.reasoning_default
# Pass llm to an Agent, or make a direct UnifiedLLM call:
# For a direct UnifiedLLM call, override only this request:
try:
    reply = await llm.acall(messages, reasoning_level="low")
finally:
    await llm.aclose()
```

- Omit `reasoning_levels` (or use null) for unknown support; `{}` declares
  selection unsupported. The public property returns `None`, `()`, or a tuple
  of valid labels respectively. Invalid selections raise, naming the choices.
- `reasoning_default` is metadata, not a selection: if supplied it must name
  a declared level and describe the base configuration. `reasoning_level=None`
  on a call bypasses a persistent selection and uses those base parameters.
- Declare levels/defaults on the registry entry or client constructor, never
  per-call or in `extra_body`. Do not combine a selected level with a per-call
  raw setting of the same key (including inside `extra_body`); that raises.
  Level blocks cannot change routing, credentials, messages or framework controls.
  Construct a new client when changing routes rather than reusing its level map.
- Use provider documentation or catalogues as candidates, then check the actual
  route's outgoing HTTP fields: SDKs and gateways may reject or silently drop
  settings. HTTP acceptance alone does not prove a level was honored. Leave
  unverified choices unknown rather than inventing mappings.
- This controls effort, not retention of stored reasoning. Changing effort may
  invalidate the cached prefix; labels are not comparable across providers.

See [reasoning-level configuration](../../docs/reasoning-levels.md) for reserved
keys, transport caveats, and bounded validation commands. The
`examples/reasoning_levels/llm_config.yaml` entries require explicit loading;
they are not automatically available registry aliases.
