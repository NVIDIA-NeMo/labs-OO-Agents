# nooa-coder

`nooa-coder` holds the Session layer for NOOA interactive agents: a `Session`
that owns one agent and its turn loop, a `SessionRegistry` that keeps the tree
of sessions (a root and the children it delegates to), the agent-side port
(`self.session`) through which an agent creates and talks to children, and a
headless in-process host (`open_tree`).

Status: pre-release. The package is part of the workspace but is not published
yet, and its API may change until the hosts switch over to it. The coding
agent, the ACP adapter and the benchmark host move onto it in later changes.

The design is tracked in issue #388.


## Dispatch and durable input

Session supplies two core turn hooks: cancellable preparation for pending model
activation, and synchronous commit for durable input ownership. Initial
`ItemConsumed` rows and `TurnStarted` are appended in one SQLite transaction before
any dequeue or agent invocation. Core does not know Session IDs or storage.
`admit()` is the synchronous record-before-queue surface for registry event delivery;
`submit()` remains its async facade. `requeue()` owns `ItemRequeued` and the queue
transfer, without changing identity or replay policy. Lifecycle/client-sharing hooks
are constructor parameters (`before_close`, `llm_in_use`); `closing` is public.

A preparation/commit failure leaves inputs queued and pauses dispatch. Existing
prompt/outcome waiters fail with `TurnFailedError`, including a later outcome query;
new external admission is rejected while `dispatch_error` is set. Repair the fault,
then call `session.resume_dispatch()` explicitly, or close/reopen to replay eligible
input. Resume first requeues retained buffered steers. Already reported terminal
outcomes are not rewritten by retry: observe updates or submit a new prompt. A
preparation cancellation likewise pauses without consumption and resolves open
prompts as cancelled; explicit resume can retry the still-queued input. A normal
committed cancellation retains the existing cancelled-output/TurnCancelled contract.

Blocked dispatch rejects external submit/prompt/steer work, but internal registry
admission still records and queues child deliveries while paused. Finished children
are auto-closed only after successful delivery; if ledger admission itself fails,
the child remains live with its own durable result available for recovery.

Pause is live dispatch control, not durable suspension. Session close pauses before
children cleanup, then stops/settles the loop and closes owned resources. Recursive
close from cleanup (including callback child tasks) is safe; self-close from an
executing turn is rejected. Closed sessions resolve late outcome queries for queued
admissions too. Core loop details are in `src/nooa/runtime/README.md`.

Steers during preparation are ordinary queued messages. During execution, buffered
steers are consumed one at a time before the next model call; close/cancel/failure
leftovers are admitted as messages with the same IDs. Recording failures retain
remaining buffer ownership, fail relevant outcomes and block dispatch. Mid-turn
get/drain consumption keeps its identity until the ledger write succeeds; failure
moves consumed-but-unrecorded ownership into a separate orphan recovery map (not
queued identity tracking), retaining the object, channel and error. It fails the
relevant prompt and the turn even if the method returns Done. Submitting the same
object after resume creates a new, independently settled receipt. The raw
item has already reached the consumer at that point, so resume cannot magically
replay it in memory. Close/reopen can replay its never-recorded consumption; external
side effects may already have occurred. This is not exactly-once execution.

Model selections are persisted immediately; effective model info/options change
only on successful activation. Pending activation is attempted once, not implicitly
retried every turn. A failed activation restores the old client and retains the new
client for cleanup. Old/pending/failed clients remain owned across cancelled disposal
or metadata failure; clients shared with children are retired until children close.
A hung old-client close is cancellable preparation with input still queued and old
cleanup ownership retained. Final resource close requires cooperative clients; there
is no timeout/forced-disposal policy in this change.

### Compatibility and scope

The prototype `before_turn(notification)` was new, unpublished and had no external
callers in this checkout. It combined async preparation with recording after
consumption, so preserving that contract would defeat the approved boundary. It is
replaced by `prepare()` and synchronous `commit(batch)`, rather than a compatibility
shim that silently changes notification timing. Supplied hook tests migrate to these
APIs and explicit blocked-dispatch recovery; unrelated assertions stay intact.
`stop_starting()` remains an alias for pause. Existing race callers are unchanged.

Crash load still requeues only admitted items without recorded consumption,
withdrawal or discard. It does not resume Python coroutines or consumed Waiting
obligations. No new delivery IDs or replay policy are introduced. Commands/mode
remain host-neutral; ask mode still does not enforce permissions. Later reasoning,
MCP/auth, command serialization and adapter initialization are outside this change.
Shared reader guides and GitHub are not modified.
