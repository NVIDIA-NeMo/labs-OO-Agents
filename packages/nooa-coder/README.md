# nooa-coder

`nooa-coder` holds the Session layer for NOOA interactive agents: a `Session`
that owns one agent and its turn loop, a `SessionRegistry` that keeps the tree
of sessions (a root and the children it delegates to), the agent-side port
(`self.session`) through which an agent creates and talks to children, and a
headless in-process host (`open_tree`). It also holds the coding agent that
runs on that layer: `nooa_coder.coding.agent:CodingAgent` is the agent spec a
host passes in `SessionOptions.agent_spec`.

Status: pre-release. The package is part of the workspace but is not published
yet, and its API may change until the hosts switch over to it. The ACP
adapter and the benchmark host move onto it in later changes.

Sessions are stored per workspace, in `<workspace>/.nooa/sessions`
(`sessions_root(workspace)`), where the `nooa-acp` server and the TUI keep
theirs; sessions they wrote are listed and load, with their saved agent
state when it can be restored. `NOOA_SESSIONS_DIR`, or an explicit
`SessionOptions.sessions_dir` / `--sessions-dir`, names one shared directory
for all workspaces instead. A `SessionRegistry` serves one such directory;
a subagent's session goes in its root's.

A host never holds a session's agent (`Session._agent` is private). It
submits items (`submit`, `prompt`, `steer`, `withdraw`, `cancel`) and reads
and changes the session through data: `info`, `transcript()`, `channels()`,
`model_info()`, `set_model()`, `set_reasoning()`, `set_mode()`,
`commands()` and `invoke_command()`, `host_status()` (agent-specific status
such as the coding agent's context and todos), and, before the first turn,
`prepare_tools()` and `register_tools()`. `subscribe()` delivers every
change as a pydantic update, in order: turns, items, title, mode, model,
reasoning level, commands, usage, children, close, and each of the agent's
own events (`AgentEventUpdate`). The ACP adapter uses only these; a test
checks that the `nooa_coder.acp` package reads no `agent` attribute.

Over ACP, a `session/prompt` sent during a turn is queued, not steered.
`_nooa/session/inject` queues or steers a message without a prompt request,
and `_nooa/session/revoke_inject` takes one back; see `docs/acp-router.md`
("Messages during a turn") and the ACP RFD for message injection
(agent-client-protocol PR #1261).

The design is tracked in issue #388.
